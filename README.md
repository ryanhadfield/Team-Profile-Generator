# Team Profile Generator

## Description

Use this [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) command-line application that takes in information about employees on a web engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage, using [inquirer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) that displays summaries for each person. 
Testing is key to making code maintainable, so I've written a unit test using [Jest.js](https://jestjs.io/) to ensure the code passes the tests.
